# Data Science Tasks

This repository contains various data science tasks assigned to us for Data Science and Machine Learning internship at BrainyBeam Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The tasks are implemented as a part  using Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of data science, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Task List

1. Data Preprocessing: Perform various data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, handling categorical data, and scaling numerical features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, visualize relationships between variables, and identify patterns and trends.

3. Feature Engineering: Apply feature engineering techniques such as creating new features, handling outliers, and transforming variables to improve the performance of machine learning models.

4. Model Selection and Training: Select appropriate machine learning models based on the problem type and dataset characteristics. Train the models using the prepared data and evaluate their performance.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score.


## Usage

Each task is implemented as a separate Python script, and the required datasets (if applicable) are provided in the repository. To run a specific task, follow the instructions provided in the respective script's comments.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running:
 - numpy==1.21.0
 - pandas==1.3.0
 - matplotlib==3.4.2
 - scikit-learn==0.24.2
 - seaborn==0.11.1
